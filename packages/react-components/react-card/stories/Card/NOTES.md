Goals:

- Teach the user what the component does as quick as possible

How:

- Do not use style overrides
- Do not use factories for creating stories, inline all code for immediate clarity

Anatomy:

- Should show all components/slots used in the story
- Should show components/slots used in the public API only (not components used internally)
- Should follow Portals (fibers)
